# Using the Mobile Wallet

One easy way to experiment with the Alfajores Testnet is to install the Celo Mobile Wallet. This section explains how to download the wallet and how to get invited onto the network.

### Getting Started

You can download the Celo wallet for Android from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.celo.mobile.alfajores) or for iOS on [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/s212x3Rp). Once you install the app, an account will be created for you and you will be able to verify your phone number. Since verifying your phone number costs gas, you have to fund your account using the [Alfajores faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucet) to pay for the verification process. 

If you already have an account \(and the corresponding seed phrase\), you can download the Celo wallet for Android from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.celo.mobile.alfajores) or for iOS on [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/s212x3Rp) and follow instructions in the app to import your wallet using the seed phrase.

If you need more funds, you can always visit [celo.org/build/faucet](https://celo.org/build/faucet) and enter your address to get more CELO and Celo Dollars (cUSD).
